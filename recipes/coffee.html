    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Follow this recipe to make the <em>BEST</em> classic cup of Joe!</p>
        <p>This recipe celebrates the natural and irresistable flavour of coffee, 
        so if you're a classic coffee lover like us, this recipe is for you!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18g ground espresso, or 1 espresso pod</li>
        <li>100ml milk</li>
        <li>the right cup: preferrably 150-200ml capacity</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make around 35ml espresso using your coffee machine and pour into the 
            base of your cup.</li>
        <li>Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so 
            that it has around 1-2cm of foam on top. Hold 
            the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above 
            the cup and pour the milk in steadily. 
            As the volume within the cup increases, 
            bring the jug as close to the surface of the 
            drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the 
            centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the 
            surface of the coffee, tilt the jug to speed up the 
            rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the 
            back of the cup and start naturally folding in on
             itself to create a pattern on the top.</li>
    </ol>
