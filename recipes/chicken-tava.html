<h1>Chicken Tava Recipe</h1>
<img src="../img/chicken-tava.jpg" alt="Turkish dish called chicken Tava">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A <em>simple</em> and <em>delicious</em> Turkish dish that is really easy to make!</p>
    <p>If you love tomato sauces in general - I go through 
        phases of pretty much living on tomato sauces at
         times, and let's face it, many others do too! They 
         are just so easy, inexpensive, healthy and delicious - 
         chicken tava is a great way to turn a classic staple meal into something
          a little more exciting. Or simply add a bit of variety 
          in your day to day meals.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken breast</li>
        <li>two onions</li>
        <li>bell peppers</li>
        <li>button mushrooms</li>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
        <li>chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop all the vegetables, 
            finely chop the garlic and dice the chicken breast</li>
        <li>Pan fry the onions in a bit of olive oil on low/medium 
            heat. As the onion start to soften up, add the mushrooms
             and garlic and carry on frying for a couple of minutes. 
             Add the chicken and cook enough to seal the outer layer.</li>
        <li>Add the tin of tomato, 200ml water (basically half of 
            the empty tin), the harissa paste, tomato paste, 
            butter, salt, black pepper and let it simmer, 
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>As the tomatoes start to break down, add the bell 
            pepper (and a little bit of extra water if it's 
            looking too 'dry'). Carry on cooking until the tomatoes 
            have broken down, the bell pepper chunks have softened 
            up and the excess water has evaporated.</li>
    </ol>
